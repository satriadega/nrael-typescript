## Starting a Project

To start a TypeScript project using `npm`, run:

```bash
$ npm start FolderName
```

## TypeScript Usage

- is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to help developers build safer and more maintainable applications.
- Early Error Detection: Catch errors during development instead of runtime.
- Improved Code Quality: Enforces better design patterns and clean code.
- Scalability: Easier management of large codebases.
- Enhanced Collaboration: Clear type definitions make it easier for teams to understand and maintain code.
- Strong IDE Support: Provides features like code navigation, refactoring tools, and code completion.

## Compiling with Error Prevention

You can compile a TypeScript file using the tsc (TypeScript Compiler) with the --noEmitOnError flag to prevent generating output files if there are errors:

```bash
$ tsc --noEmitOnError hello.ts
```

## Downleveling

This process of moving from a newer or “higher” version of ECMAScript down to an older or “lower” one is sometimes called downleveling.
